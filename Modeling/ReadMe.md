# README - HATP Travel Profile Modeling

## **TL;DR:** 
The DIF Hospitality & Travel SIG Travel Profile project is using the [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com) modeling tool. This is a text based modeling tool that can automatically UML Class, Sequence and other diagram types.

As it is text based it is a natural fit for GitHub and for those who a coders by nature vs. graphics tool oriented.

PlantUML can be installed locally (Mac, Windows) and integrated with Visual Studio code, which, in turn can be integrated with the [H&T online GitHub instance](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ht-travel-profile).

While PlantUML has an [online editor](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/SyfFKj2rKt3CoKnELR1Io4ZDoSa70000), the PlantText [editor](https://planttext.com) is better and has a faster response time.
